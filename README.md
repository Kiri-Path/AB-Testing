**Business Perspective Summary of A/B Testing:**
A/B testing, in a business context, is a method used to compare two versions of a product, webpage, or marketing strategy to determine which one performs better in achieving a specific goal, such as increased sales or user engagement. By randomly assigning users to two groups – A (the control group) and B (the experimental group) – businesses can systematically test changes in design, content, or features. This data-driven approach helps companies make informed decisions, reduce guesswork, and optimize their products or services to enhance customer satisfaction and drive growth.

**Statistical Perspective Summary of A/B Testing:**
From a statistical standpoint, A/B testing involves hypothesis testing to evaluate the effectiveness of changes. The process begins by formulating a null hypothesis (H0) that assumes no difference between the two versions. Data collected from both groups are then analyzed to calculate key metrics and test statistics. Statistical significance is determined using p-values and confidence intervals, which help to assess whether observed differences are due to chance or actual effects of the changes implemented. Ensuring a sufficient sample size and controlling for variables are critical to achieving reliable and valid results, ultimately guiding data-driven decision-making.
